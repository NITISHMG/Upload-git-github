Duration: 3 hrs											Max. Marks: 100
Note: Chart extracted from IRC code book can use.
Answer five full questions choosing one complete question from each module.

	Module 1	Marks	RBT	CO
1 a)	What are the objects and scope of traffic engineering? Explain briefly.	6	L1	CO1
b)	What are the different vehicular characteristics which affect the road design? Briefly explain.	7	L2	CO1
c)	A passenger car weighing 2 tones is required to accelerate at a rate of 3m/ sec2   in the first      gear from a speed of 10 kmph. The gradient is +1 percent and the road has a black topped surface. The frontal projection area of the car is 2m2 The car tyre has a radius of 0.33m. The rear axle gear ratio is 3.82:1 and first gear ratio is 2.78:1 compute the engine horse power needed and the speed of the engine. Make suitable assumptions.	7	L3	CO1

2.	The design speed for checking the geometric design elements of the highway	10	L4	CO2
OR
4 a)	What are the factors on which PCU values depends	4	L1	CO2
b)	Illustrate the various uses of speed and delay studies	6	L3	CO2
c)	A vehicle of weight 2.0 tonne skids through a distance equal to 40m before colliding with another parked vehicle of weight 1.0 tonne. After collision both the vehicles skid through a distance equal to 12m before stopping. Compute the initial speed of the moving vehicle. Assume average coefficient of friction as 0.5.	10	L4	CO2

b)	A toll booth at the entrance to a bridge can handle 120veh/hour, the time to process a vehicle being exponentially distributed. The flow is 90 veh/hour with a poissonian arrival pattern. Determine.
i)	The average number of vehicle in the system.
ii)	The length of the queue.
iii)	The average time spent by the vehicle in the queue.
iv)	The average time spent by the vehicle in the System.	10	L4	CO3,4
Module 4
7a)	The data in following table shows the occupancy of parking spaces in a parking lot consisting of 50spaces. The count was taken as 15 minute intervals during the 4 hours duration between 11:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M on 6week days (Monday to Saturday). Find by inspection whether the number of vacant spaces during any count follows a Poisson distribution.

Occupancy of parking spaces	Frequency

48	21
47	20
46	15
45	10
44	5
43	2

40 and less	0
	10	L2	CO5
b)	The spot speeds at a particular location on an expressway are known to be normally distributed with a mean of 80 kmph. A new radar speedometer was bought by Traffic Department and a set of 100 observations of speeds was taken. The mean speed observed was 77.3 kmph and the standard deviation was 15 kmph. Is there any evidence to prove that	10	L3	CO5
OR
8 a)	Briefly Explain the significance testing	10	L2	CO5
b)	In order to assess whether the is any relationship between the accident and the age of drivers, an analysis of previous data yielded the following
		Age group of drivers	Total accidents
Accident Severity 		18-30	30-50	Above 50	
	Fatal	15	7	22	44
	Grievous Injury	29	11	38	78
	Minor Injury	35	82	95	212
		79	100	155	334
